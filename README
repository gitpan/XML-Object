XML::Object version 0.02
=======================

XML::Object allows easy (XML) configuration of a Perl script/module
by associating methods with elements. Because each method has its
own configuration 'namespace', the structure of the XML reflects
that of the object and vice-versa. This partitioning leads to a
simple and intuitive organisation of the configuration space.

XML::Object::DBI adds database accessors (get) and mutators (set) to
the mix. These shield the user from DBI housekeeping while freeing them
to manage the SQL in a convenient and flexible way.

See the POD for more details.
